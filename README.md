# WobblePad

**Turn your balance board into an Android gamepad or Windows arrow controller.**

WobblePad is an experimental Android and Windows bridge for a user-owned BoBo
Wobbly balance board. It connects directly over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
turns the board's continuous tilt stream into calibrated X/Y values, and sends
virtual gamepad or arrow-key input to compatible software.

## Current status

This repository contains a working prototype, not a production release.

- BLE scan, connection, notification streaming, packet parsing, calibration,
  stall detection, reconnect, battery reading, and CSV export are implemented.
- The direct BLE stream was exercised on a Samsung SM-X210 running Android 16
  for about ten minutes and received 3,204 packets. That test does not prove
  compatibility with every board revision or Android device.
- The virtual controller uses Shizuku to open Android's `/dev/uhid` interface.
  Kernel policy, manufacturer changes, Shizuku state, and the receiving game's
  input support can all affect whether controller output works.
- The Windows app connects through Bleak and emits arrow keys through the
  documented Win32 `SendInput` API. Some games that read only raw hardware
  input may ignore synthesized keys.
- The Windows bundle has passed automated tests and a packaged startup check;
  direct BLE and game-input behavior still require physical qualification.
- There is no signed production APK, Windows installer, or store release yet.
  Build from source while the compatibility surface is still being tested.

## What the Android app does

1. Scans for a device whose name contains `BoBo` or advertises the known custom
   service.
2. Connects with Android BLE/GATT without classic Bluetooth pairing.
3. Enables notifications once on the custom characteristic.
4. Parses each 20-byte notification into nine signed little-endian values.
5. Captures center, left, right, forward, and backward calibration poses.
6. Projects live sensor vectors onto calibrated X/Y axes with smoothing and a
   dead zone.
7. Sends either an analog gamepad or repeated arrow-key pulses through Android
   UHID when Shizuku access is available.
8. Offers a **Close BoBo Home** button that uses the same granted Shizuku access
   to stop `com.bobo.home` and release its BLE connection.

Live BLE display, calibration, packet rate, and CSV export work without
Shizuku. Shizuku is needed only for system-visible controller output.

## What the Windows app does

The Windows app scans and connects directly through the operating system's BLE
stack, captures the same five calibration poses, and emits global arrow-key
pulses for as long as a direction remains tilted. It releases every held key
when output stops, BLE disconnects, or the app closes. Four independent
sensitivity sliders control left, right, forward, and backward movement; the
dead-zone and key-repeat interval have separate sliders. Calibration and
settings remain in the current user's local app-data folder.

## Why Shizuku is needed

Android deliberately isolates ordinary apps from global input injection. A
normal app can receive input and can communicate with BLE peripherals, but it
cannot register an arbitrary system-wide hardware controller for other apps.
WobblePad's small user service asks Shizuku for the Android shell identity and
uses that identity to open `/dev/uhid`, the kernel interface that creates a
virtual HID device.

WobblePad does not bundle Shizuku, root the device, modify firmware, or bypass a
game's input policy. On a non-rooted Android device, Shizuku normally has to be
started again after reboot through Android's wireless-debugging flow. Review
the [Shizuku documentation](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/) before
granting access.

## Android requirements

- Android 12 or later (`minSdk 31`)
- Bluetooth LE hardware
- A compatible BoBo Wobbly board
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/download/) for virtual controller output
- A game or app that accepts Android gamepad or keyboard input

Only one BLE central can commonly hold a peripheral connection at a time.
Disconnect nRF Connect, the official app, and other BLE clients before testing.

## Windows requirements

- Windows 11
- Bluetooth LE hardware
- A compatible BoBo Wobbly board
- Python 3.11 or later and `uv` when building from source

The packaged Windows build includes its Python runtime and dependencies. It
does not require Shizuku or a custom driver.

## Build

Install JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 36, Python 3.11 or later, and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then clone the repository. The Gradle wrapper
downloads the declared Gradle version.

On Windows:

```powershell
uv sync --project scripts --locked
uv sync --project windows-app --locked
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/validate-repository.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/run-tests.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/build-android.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/deploy-android.py
uv run --project windows-app --locked python scripts/build-windows.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/deploy-windows.py
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
uv sync --project scripts --locked
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/validate-repository.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/run-tests.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/build-android.py
uv run --project scripts --locked python scripts/deploy-android.py
```

The Windows package must be built and installed on Windows because PyInstaller
does not cross-compile Windows executables.

Android Studio can also open the repository root directly. Debug builds use the
standard per-machine Android debug key; no signing key is stored here.

Validation and test helpers write portable results to `.test-results/`, bound
to a source-content digest and the latest commit that changed those source
inputs. Supporting logs stay under the
ignored `.test-results/evidence/` directory. Build and deployment emit bounded
JSON to standard output; platform artifacts remain in ignored build
directories. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the feature-to-observation map and
the hardware checks that remain manual.

## Use on Android

1. Power on the board and keep it awake.
2. Open WobblePad and allow Nearby devices and notification permissions.
3. Tap **Scan for BoBo**, then select the detected board.
4. Capture `CENTER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, and `DOWN`. `UP` means away from
   you. Hold each pose steady for three seconds.
5. Finish calibration and verify the live dot follows the board.
6. For controller output, start Shizuku, grant WobblePad access, choose analog
   stick or arrow keys, and tap **Start controller output**.
7. Open a controller-compatible app. Return to WobblePad or use its foreground
   notification to stop the bridge.

Calibration is stored locally and keyed to the board's Bluetooth address. It is
not included in this repository and is not transmitted by the app.

## Use on Windows

1. Run `WobblePad.exe`, power on the board, and close other BLE clients.
2. Scan, choose the board, and connect.
3. Capture center, left, right, up/forward, and down/backward; then finish
   calibration.
4. Adjust any directional sensitivity, the center dead zone, or the key-repeat
   interval.
5. Start arrow output, then open an arrow-controlled game. Return to WobblePad
   to stop output before disconnecting.

## BLE protocol

The prototype uses these observed GATT identifiers:

| Purpose | UUID |
| --- | --- |
| Service | `856b152a-734a-5546-bf2b-ed4898184e12` |
| Stream characteristic | `856b152b-734a-5546-bf2b-ed4898184e12` |
| Client Characteristic Configuration | `00002902-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |
| Battery service | `0000180f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

Notifications are enabled with the standard CCCD value `01 00`. Each accepted
packet starts with `0x41`, ends with `0x42`, and contains nine signed 16-bit
little-endian values between those markers. The mapper uses all nine observed
values and learns physical direction from the five calibration poses instead
of assigning undocumented sensor axes.

The format was independently documented by observing BLE data transmitted by
a user-owned device. The repository contains no BO&BO application code,
firmware, artwork, games, backend access, or paid features.

## Privacy and security

The manifest does not request Internet access. BLE data, calibration, and the
bounded recent-packet CSV buffer remain on the Android device. A CSV leaves the
app only when the user chooses a destination through Android's document picker.
Do not publish Bluetooth addresses or raw captures without sanitizing them.

On Android, Shizuku grants elevated local capability. WobblePad limits its user
service to creating and updating one virtual input device, releases all input
on stop or failure, and does not expose that service to other apps. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and trust-boundary details.
